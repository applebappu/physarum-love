PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM

Well, not really.  I originally sought to emulate a lot more of the lifecycle and
the pathfinding behavior, but when I got it all working I realized it was just a
lot more interesting to watch without that stuff.

If you want to add pathfinding / plasmodial consolidation, you wanna put a lot less
food on the board, and make the board absolutely huge.  Otherwise, it's just not
that cool to look at, since the whole plasmodium becomes paths anyway.

Calling this one done.
